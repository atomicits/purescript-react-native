# purescript-react-native

Low-level PureScript bindings for React Native based on [purescript-react](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-react). These have only been tested on Android but should, in theory, also work for iOS.

To use this, see the example project [here](https://github.com/nicholaskariniemi/purescript-react-native-sampleapp).

This is very much pre-alpha work.
